Complete knowledge refresher of JavaScript, Node.JS, Python, and other various front-end/back-end frameworks. I began by prompting ChatGPT with the following: "Over the course of the last 2 years, I haven't done any coding though and I forgot how to code. From now on, could you help me learn to code again and act as a teacher, mentor, advisor, and code reviewer for me?" The entire syllabus has been created by ChatGPT.
